Prompt:

Build a desktop application using CustomTkinter for a social media automation panel UI that manages multiple accounts (at least 3). The UI should have a modern, clean, and intuitive design with a sidebar that includes the following sections:

1. Sidebar Menu
The sidebar should have four main options:

Accounts:

- Displays all uploaded accounts in a list format. show empty if there is no accounts uploaded, it will be a dataframe with many columns and pagination if needed
- A button to add an account manually (email & password input fields).
- A button to add accounts in batch via a .txt file.

Actions:

- Allows users to configure automation actions:
Comments, posts, live views, likes, and shares.
- Option to select which accounts will perform actions on a specific post, run, stop and edit actions buttons.
Time configuration to schedule or randomize execution.

Monitor:

- A dashboard showing logs of all account activities with enriched logs (using rich python library).
- Displays system resource usage (CPU & memory) to prevent crashes (select the best and more less memory consumption option for this).


Settings:

- Scraping settings: Define which social media accounts to track for new posts.
- Customization: Upload images/messages for posts and comments.
Theme selection: Light/Dark mode and UI adjustments.

2. UI Requirements
The main layout should be a resizable CustomTkinter frame with adaptive widgets.
Use CTkListbox, CTkEntry, CTkButton, CTkScrollbar where needed.
The Monitor tab should include a real-time progress bar and logs using CTkTextbox.
The Settings section should feature dropdowns, checkboxes, and file upload fields.

3. Additional Features:
Allow adding multiple accounts and controlling them independently.
Implement multi-threading to handle actions without freezing the UI.
Ensure efficient resource monitoring to prevent system overload and error handling for avoiding the app to crash.
